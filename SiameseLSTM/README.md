## ðŸ§  Overview

The system:
- Preprocesses raw signature data (normalization, interpolation)
- Generates balanced positive and negative signature pairs
- Trains a Siamese LSTM network using contrastive loss
- Evaluates model performance on all person-wise combinations
- Visualizes training progress, distributions, and performance metrics

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Format

The project expects a folder structure like this:

```
Signatures/
â”œâ”€â”€ person1/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ sig01.txt
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ sig02.txt
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ person2/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ sig01.txt
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each `.txt` file should contain 3 columns (X, Y, Time).  



## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs
All results are stored under the training_outputs/ directory:

â€¢	models/ â€“ trained models for each test pair

â€¢	processors/ â€“ saved data preprocessors

â€¢	thresholds/ â€“ optimal cosine distance thresholds

â€¢	test_results/ â€“ ROC, loss, confusion matrix plots

â€¢	all_combinations_results.pkl â€“ summary of all training combinations


## ðŸ“‰ Evaluation Metrics

â€¢	Accuracy

â€¢	Precision

â€¢	Recall

â€¢	F1-score

â€¢	ROC AUC (via plotting)

â€¢	Confusion matrix and distance distributions

## ðŸ“Š Post-Training Analysis
After all person combinations have been evaluated, the script analyze_all_combinations_results.py allows you to analyze the overall performance of the model across different test sets.
Key Features:

â€¢	Per-Person Performance Stats:

Computes average, standard deviation, min, and max for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score when each person is in the test set.

â€¢	Combination-Level Summary:

Reports best/worst performing pairs and overall statistical distributions.

â€¢	Difficulty Estimation:

Identifies the hardest and easiest persons to recognize based on average accuracy.

â€¢	Performance Distributions:

Categorizes accuracy values into ranges (e.g., low, medium, high) for interpretability.

â€¢	Graphs and Visualizations:

o	Accuracy distribution

o	Threshold distribution

o	Person-wise bar chart with error bars

o	Scatter plot (threshold vs. accuracy)

All graphs are saved under the analysis_outputs/ directory as combination_analysis_plots.png.

â€¢	Export to CSV:

o	combinations_results.csv: Performance stats per person pair

o	person_statistics.csv: Aggregate stats per person

## ðŸ“„ Publication Context
This project was developed as part of a scientific research study focused on Contactless Biometric Verification from In-Air Signatures using a Deep Siamese Network architecture.
